# JavaScriptmas Day 4 - Whispering function 

Write a function `whisper` that takes in a sentence 
and returns a new sentence in all lowercase letters with
"shh..." at the beginning. 

The function should also remove an exclamation point
at the end of the sentence, if there is one. 

Example 
* input: "The KITTENS are SLEEPING!"
* output: "shh... the kittens are sleeping"
