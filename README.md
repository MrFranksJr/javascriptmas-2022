# JavaScriptmas 2022 - an advent calendar of challenges

Welcome to JavaScriptmas 2022, a daily challenge from the 1st of December 2022 until the 24th.

A new door will open every single day from December 1st to 24th, revealing a small coding challenge for you to solve.

It's a contest, where every challenge you solve, gives you a bigger chance at winning the grand prize at the end of the ride.

I think it's a really nice incentive to keep challenging me and to keep me engaged with JavaScript. I'm really enjoying this series of little challenges.

Get into the subfolders to learn about the different assignments.
