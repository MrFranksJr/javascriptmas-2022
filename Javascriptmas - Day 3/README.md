# JavaScriptmas Day 3 - Favorite Foods

## Topic: Object Destructuring
* 1. Edit the faveFoods object so that it contains 
your favorite foods.
* 2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts: 
breakfast, lunch, and supper.
* 3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM.
* 4. Set the innerHTML content of the meals <section> to a paragraph
that states what your favorite foods are for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Use a template literal to construct the string.

E.g.
For breakfast, I only like croissants 🥐. For lunch, I love pasta 🍝, 
and for supper I want usually want pizza 🍕.
